# Momentum Strategy

This is a very simple momentum strategy, where I used:-

YFinance - To download the inputted Ticker Symbol's data
Panadas - To store the data from the stock
Matplotlib - For plotting the Moving Averages and buy/sell signals

This code allows you to see the 20-Day and 50-Day Moving Averages compared to the stock's Close Price. It is just for an experiment, and not to be carried out for actual trades.

### Warning: This is not financial advice, I'm not a financial advisor. This is just for research, testing, and learning.
